Description: PDBCleanup is an R package to preprocess PDB protein structure 
    files for later analysis. Its features include selecting well-predicted 
    subsections from structures, aligning individual domains, and visualizing 
    structure prediction quality. PDBCleanup functions are highly customizable 
    according to user through optional arguments, to ensure the method for 
    preprocessing the protein structure matches what the user requires for 
    their analysis. While PDBCleanup is oriented primarily for improvement of 
    predicted protein structures produced by AlphaFold2, it is applicable to 
    any protein structure and can be similarly applied to structures obtained 
    from experiments or other computational prediction methods.
