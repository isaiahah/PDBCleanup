## Description
PDBCleanup is an R package developed as part of the University of Toronto Fall 2023 course BCB410. It provides utilities for improving the quality of PDB protein structure files by selecting high resolution regions and improving relative domain positions by superimposing individual regions against corresponding regions of another reference protein structure. It further allows visualization of a quality score along an input protein's sequence, visualization of the 3D protein structure produced after selecting high quality regions and performing superimposition, and visualization of the structural difference between a pair of protein structures.

This package is beneficial as a pre-processing step before performing analysis using protein structural data. It is compatible with other common structural biology packages but provides new highly customizable functions to streamline the first steps of structural data preparation.

PDBCleanup was developed in an environment using `R version 4.3.1` on an `aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)` platform running `macOS Sonoma 14.0`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of PDBCleanup from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("isaiahah/PDBCleanup", buildVignettes = TRUE)
library("PDBCleanup")
```

## Overview
```
ls("package:PDBCleanup")
data(package = "PDBCleanup") 
browseVignettes("PDBCleanup")
```

There are X functions in `PDBCleanup`:
